School21 project. Creating liteweight version of bash in command of two people (whith [Baxetle23](https://github.com/baxetle23)).

You can use it like bash. almost all commands works, but we didn't realise some features (we just following by school's subject).
So if some didn't work like in bash - it's becouse we didn't (or we have some bugs ;F).

To compile, you need to install the readline library.
